                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am curently a junior and a computer science student
                    at CUNY Brooklyn College. I aspire to be a software
                    developer because I enjoy solving problems and learning
                    simultaneously. I code in Java and have a few experiences
                    using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React. 
                    I have participated in different internships
                    including occupying a data analyst role at the Office of the
                    New York City Public Advocate for 5 weeks. I also have experience
                    working with information systems. 
                    By June 6 2022, I will be joining Harborvest Partners in Boston
                    for 10 weeks as a Technical Support Intern where 
                    I would be able to gain so much knowledge while I 
                    work alongside skillful and intelligent engineers.
                    As an upbeat, self-motivated team player with excellent
                    communication skills, I look forward to acquiring and applying
                    skills when needed while I hope to have both the skill set 
                    and professional background necessary to have an exciting
                    future in the tech world. During my free time, I try my best to 
                    sleep as much as I can, watch movies, and listen to music.
